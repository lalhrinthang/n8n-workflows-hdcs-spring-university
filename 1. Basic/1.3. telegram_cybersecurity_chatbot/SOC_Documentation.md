2️⃣ Executive Summary
The AI Cyber Security Q&A Chatbot is a guardrailed, educational security assistant designed to provide accurate, defensive, and ethical responses to cyber security–related questions.
The system uses automation (n8n) and an OpenAI language model with strict controls to ensure:
--> Only cybersecurity topics are answered
--> No hacking or misuse guidance is provided
--> Unrelated questions are safely rejected
--> This solution supports security awareness training, a key function in modern Security Operations Centers (SOC).

7️⃣ Detection & Validation Logic
7.1 Topic Validation
Before invoking the AI model, the system validates whether the user query is cyber security related.
Allowed Topic Keywords (Examples)
phishing
malware
password
vpn
firewall
cyber security
online safety
privacy
If no valid topic is detected, the query is rejected.

7.2 Safety Guardrails
The system blocks or safely redirects requests containing:
“hack”
“bypass”
“exploit”
“crack”
“steal”

8️⃣ AI Control Mechanism
8.1 AI Model
OpenAI Chat Model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini)
8.2 System Prompt (Behavior Lock)
The AI is configured with a strict system instruction to:
Respond only to cyber security topics
Provide educational, defensive explanations
Refuse non-security or harmful requests
This ensures policy compliance and ethical AI usage.

9️⃣ Response Policy
Allowed Responses
Definitions
Awareness guidance
Best practices
High-level explanations
Restricted Responses
Step-by-step attacks
Tool recommendations for hacking
Code or exploit details

10️⃣ Rejection & Fallback Handling
Unrelated Question Response
I can only assist with cyber security related topics such as phishing, malware, password safety, and online security.

Unsafe Request Response
I can provide cybersecurity education and awareness, but I can’t assist with hacking or illegal activities.
